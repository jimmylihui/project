# Principal component analysis machine learning determine members in globular cluster M56
## purpose
The project using machine learning with PCA to determine the member in globular cluster M56. The learning method are super vector machine and artificial neural network.
Globular cluster is worth learning because the last stage of stellar evolution for low mass stars can be observed in it.
## Dataset
The training data is from Rishel et al in https://github.com/jimmylihui/project/blob/main/project.xlsx. and the testing data is fron Gaia collebration in https://github.com/jimmylihui/project/blob/main/data.txt.
## Environment 
The language used in project is Python 3.8, with the assistance of colab notebook
## Dependency
The dependence include numpy, matplotlib, pandas, numpy, sklearn, random, tensorflow. 
## usage
The code is used to show the process of building a model and applying a model. The user dont need to input the parameter. The parameter is well defined in 
the code. Running the code, the word and illustration of model can be seen below the code.
